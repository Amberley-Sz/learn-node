- In eventloop/timer.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

console log:
someAsyncOperation
101ms have passed since I was scheduled

1. 150ms
The order of the execution does not change because the event loop processes the timer callback after
the current executing callback from someAsyncOperation
But the timer callback will be delayed for adding 50ms more time

2. 0
The order has changed because the setTimeout would log its message before someAsyncOperation
it depends on the timing of the event loop's processing of timer callbacks relative to I/O callbacks
